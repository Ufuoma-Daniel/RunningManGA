# RunningManGA
Practising Genetic Algorithms
I copy and pasted the code into a blank worksheet whenever I wanted to test the code...
It's a bit jank but here is how to look at it.

Just copy it all into the worksheet and make a simulation service. Call the runSimulationMany function and the amount of times you want it to run.
There is a function called makeRunners that will create you initial population that you will have to pass in to the 
To see the the values, of the populations, just call the print functions on the starting and ending populations.
Oh and you'll want to swap the getBMIRating functions with the one thats commented.

Actually, I'm just going to push up a worksheet that works...
